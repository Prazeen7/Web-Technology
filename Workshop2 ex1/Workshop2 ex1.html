            <h1 id="Intro">Thomas J.Watson</h1>
            <p>Thomas J. Watson was a pioneer in the development of accounting and 
            computing equipment used today by business, government, 
            science and industry.<br>
            He was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM. He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956.<br>
            Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR.<br>
            He turned the company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines.<br>
            A leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.<br>
            He built a worldwide industry during his 42 years at IBM.</p>

            <p>Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874. 
                His first job was at age 18 as a bookkeeper in Clarence Risley's Market
                 in Painted Post, N.Y. <br>Later he sold sewing machines and musical instruments 
                 before joining the National Cash Register Company as a salesman in Buffalo.<br>
                 He eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. 
                 Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force,<br> Mr. Watson introduced the motto, 
                 "THINK," which later became a widely known symbol of IBM.</p>
