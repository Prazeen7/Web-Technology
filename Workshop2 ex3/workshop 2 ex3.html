        <h1>What is Advanced Text Formatting?</h1>
        <p>Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text and they are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Bold text</b></li>
                <li><strong>Important text</strong> (The content inside is typically displayed in bold)</li>
                <li><i>Italic text</i></li>
                <li><em>Emphasized text </em> (The content inside is typically displayed in italic)</li>
                <li><mark>Marked text </mark> (It highlights the text)</li>
                <li><small>Smaller text</small></li>
                <li><del>Deleted text </del> (It deletes the text and will strike a line through deleted text</li>
                <li><ins>Inserted text </ins> (It inserts a text and will underline the inserted text)</li>
                <li><sub>Subscript text</sub>(It gets texts below the normal line)</li>
                <li><sup>Superscript text</sup>(It gets text above the normal line)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                The text layout and UI controls in WPF provide formatting properties that allow you to easily include formatted text in your application.
                 These controls expose a number of properties to handle the presentation of text, which includes its typeface, size, and color. 
                 Under ordinary circumstances, these controls can handle the majority of text presentation in your application. However, some advanced scenarios require the control of text storage as well as text presentation. 
                 WPF provides an extensible text formatting engine for this purpose.The advanced text formatting features found in WPF consist of a text formatting engine, a text store, text runs, and formatting properties. 
                 The text formatting engine, TextFormatter, creates lines of text to be used for presentation. This is achieved by initiating the line formatting process and calling the text formatter's FormatLine.
                  The text formatter retrieves text runs from your text store by calling the store's GetTextRun method. 
                  The TextRun objects are then formed into TextLine objects by the text formatter and given to your application for inspection or display.
